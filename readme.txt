This is my advent of code repository.
-------------------------------------

Nowadays I'm doing the AOC in Jupyterlab with Python and
with as little mental load as possible.

Other people might publish polished solutions, if you're looking 
for those, try somewhere else.

These here will poorly named variables/functions and code that is
only as efficient as needed.

Once a job is finished, I drop the pencil and leave the
notebooks are they are. It's tempting to make them beautiful
or to rename things properly, but I will not do it, at least
not in 2022.

I also stop playing each year once the daily time needed to
solve them exceeds 45 minutes by a lot.

So you've been warned.
